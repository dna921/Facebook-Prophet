# Facebook-Prophet
This project involved time-series forecasting of stock prices using Facebook Prophet. Historical stock data, including Amazon (AMZN), was fetched usingÂ yfinance, then preprocessed to meet Prophet's requirements. The model provided accurate predictions with confidence intervals, showcasing trends and potential future price movements. Visualizations were generated to interpret both historical and forecasted data effectively. This project demonstrated expertise in time-series analysis, forecasting, and using tools like Prophet and Python for real-world applications in financial analytics.
